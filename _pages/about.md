Hi, I am a student in the Master's degree in Computer Science at La Sapienza in Rome, Italy.
I am deeply interested in computer security, containers and DevOps.

This semester I'm studying Advanced Architectures, Cloud Computing, Concurrent Systems, Data and Network Security and Practical Network Defense.

In my free time I enjoy playing padel and watching football.
