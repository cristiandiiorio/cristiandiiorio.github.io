Hi, I am a student in the Master's degree in Computer Science at La Sapienza in Rome, Italy.
I am deeply interested in computer security, containers and DevOps.

This semester I'm studying Malware Analysis, Foundations of Data Science, Big Data Computing and Computer Vision.

In my free time I enjoy playing tennis and watching football.
