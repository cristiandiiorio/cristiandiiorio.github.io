Hi, I am an undergraduate Computer Engineering student at La Sapienza in Rome, Italy.
I am deeply interested in computer security, containers and DevOps.

This semester I'm studying Computer Security, Electronics, Complements of Operating Systems, Web Development and Software Architectures.

In my free time I enjoy playing padel and watching football.
